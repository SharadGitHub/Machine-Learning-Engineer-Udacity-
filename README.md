## Project-1
In this project, we have to deploy a custom pytorch model with SageMaker for Sentiment Analysis. Once the model is 
deployed, it should be able to provide an inference to users through a website. An user would write a review on the
website which will be sent to the deployed model throught the API endpoints which we will predict whether the review
positive or negative. 

## Project-2
In this project, we have to train and deploy a network to classify a text sample as plagiarised or not. A big part
of this project was to extract useful features from the text such as containment features, longest common subsequence
